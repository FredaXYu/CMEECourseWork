abstract="In 1838 the Belgian mathematician Verhulst introduced the logistic equation, which is a kind of generalization of the equation for exponential growth but with a maximum value for the population. He used data from several countries, in particular Belgium, to estimate the unknown parameters. The work of Verhulst was rediscovered only in the 1920s.",
