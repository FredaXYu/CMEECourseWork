## Avoid my bad habits: 
- Use Google! Not Bing! 
- Read official documents! https://www.learn-r.org/r-tutorial/read-csv.php
- Use the 'help' functionality in each language! e.g. In R, type ?xxxx
- Inside of the terminal, please be aware of the environment. E.g. Inside of the terminal, you need to type 'R' to enter into the R environment. You need to type 'python3 xxx.py'. 
- Be aware of the path/directory. 
- The search methods: CSDN, WeChat Read. 
- My two glasses should be put aside of the lamp. 
- Cook colourful meals. 
- Use my earphone. 
- Check the Coursework assignment requirement, and print/write down each point to be marked to get scores.
