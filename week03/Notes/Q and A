Concatenate versus array.

Pawar, Samraat
Basically.

Pawar, Samraat
C is a more general is a more general concatenation command.

Pawar, Samraat
And you can only apply, you can only build arrays and you learned about data structures, but we'll learn more about it today.

Pawar, Samraat
In class but array is specific to.

Pawar, Samraat
Is specifically a data structure that is essentially a vector, but you can have multidimensional arrays as well.

Pawar, Samraat
So C is more general and allows you to create single one-dimensional arrays and you can combine multiple.

Pawar, Samraat
Types in there and array essentially is.

Pawar, Samraat
Is either two or three-dimensional and you know you can create a vector or matrix with it.

Pawar, Samraat
So here's.

Pawar, Samraat
A useful link.

Pawar, Samraat
That might give you a bit more idea about arrays.

Pawar, Samraat
Anything else?

Pawar, Samraat
Any other questions?

Pawar, Samraat
OK. Well, let's meet in class.

Pawar, Samraat
Oh, every time I'm threatening to leave, somebody has a question. Oh, that's your unit again. OK.

7

Pawar, Samraat
Yeah, but it depend on what the output is. Is it a result? Then it goes to results. Is it?

Duan, Bowen
I I don't know like like just the LC dot PY use the string output and do we need to write some script to?

Pawar, Samraat
I don't mean I won't. I don't need LC and all of those to output to a file. I just need to see the output on the screen.

Duan, Bowen
Oh, OK. Thank you.

Pawar, Samraat
Oh, that was your question. I see. OK. I wasn't sure which one you're talking about.

Duan, Bowen
OK. Thank you.

Pawar, Samraat
Yeah, but if you really cannot sleep and you want to put a file in the output directory, I don't mind. You can put it in results if you want.

Pawar, Samraat
It will make you happier, but I what I was asking for is a print. Nice print out on the screen.

Pawar, Samraat
OK.

Pawar, Samraat
Show and I didn't understand your comment. You said no right now do you mean not right now or right now? I don't know it.

Pawar, Samraat
Oh, I see. OK.

Pawar, Samraat
Alright. Any other questions?

Pawar, Samraat
We'll start. We'll pick up data structures today in our in another 10-15 minutes or so, 15 minutes, let's say 5 past.

Pawar, Samraat
Alright, maybe you have some more questions later and we can we can address them, of course. So. So see you in class in a bit.

Pawar, Samraat
And yeah, if you had some question and posted it now, I'll try to answer, I'll answer it online. OK. Bye. Bye. See you in a bit.
